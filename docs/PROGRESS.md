## 2026-10-26 — M0: project setup

**Done**
- Environment: `uv` 0.13.5, Python 3.14.5 (pinned in `.python-version`), `.venv/` created by `uv sync`.
- PyTorch 2.14.1 + torchvision 0.29.1 from the CUDA 12.6 index (machine: AMD Ryzen 7 6800H, NVIDIA RTX 3060 Laptop 6 GB, driver 566.07). Verified `torch.cuda.is_available()` and a torchvision CUDA op on the GPU.
- Git repo on `main`; `.gitignore` covers `/data/`, `/models/`, `/runs/`, `.venv/`, `*.onnx` (except `tests/fixtures/`), caches and secrets.
- `pyproject.toml` (src layout, hatchling) with extras `dev`, `imaging`, `app`; ruff and pytest configured; `slow` marker registered.
- Typer CLI `vstent` with stub subcommands for every command in CLAUDE.md.
- `vstent.config`: strict Pydantic base model, YAML loader, `save_run_metadata` (resolved config + git commit + dirty flag).
- `README.md` (disclaimer + quickstart), `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/DATA.md`.
- `PLAN.md` moved to `docs/PLAN.md` (the location CLAUDE.md refers to).

**Metrics**
- `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`: clean. `pytest -m "not slow"`: 9 passed in 0.9 s.

**Open issues**
- torchvision (pulled in by segmentation-models-pytorch) first resolved to the CPU build from PyPI and failed on CUDA tensors; fixed by listing it directly in the `imaging` extra with the cu126 source.
- uv was installed with winget; restart VS Code / the shell so `uv` is on PATH.
